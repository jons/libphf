ANSI C minimal perfect hash library.
CCBYSA3.0

v1.0.0 was originally compiled in the course of my work at WHOI. it comes with
bob jenkins' minimal perfect hash code. if you are interested, see his website or
the github mirror of his raw code, maintained by driedfruit.

i have since sought other minimal perfect hashes to roll into this library; if
you have one to add, do so, and send a pull request.
