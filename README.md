======

ANSI C minimal perfect hash library.
CCBYSA3.0

v1.0.0 was originally compiled in the course of my work at
<a href="http://acomms.whoi.edu/software/libphf/">WHOI</a>.

it comes with <a href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/">bob jenkins'</a> minimal
perfect hash code. if you are interested, see his website or the github mirror
of his raw code, maintained by
<a href="https://github.com/driedfruit/jenkins-minimal-perfect-hash">driedfruit</a>.

i have since sought other minimal perfect hashes to roll into this library; if
you have one to add, do so, and send a pull request.
